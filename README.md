_Retrieve the binding of a method's caller in MRI 1.9.2_

The `binding_of_caller` gem provides the `Binding#of_caller` method.

Using `binding_of_caller` we can grab bindings from higher up the call
stack and evaluate code in that context. Allows access to bindings arbitrarily far up the
call stack, not limited to just the immediate caller.

**Recommended for use only in debugging situations. Do not use this in production apps.**

**Only works in MRI Ruby 1.9.2 and 1.9.3**

* Install the [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/binding_of_caller): `gem install binding_of_caller`
* See the [source code](http://github.com/banister/binding_of_caller)

Example: Modifying a local inside the caller of a caller
--------

```ruby
def a
  var = 10
  b
  puts var
end

def b
  c
end

def c
  binding.of_caller(2).eval('var = :hello')
end

a()

# OUTPUT
# => hello
```

Spinoff project
-------

This project is a spinoff from the [Pry REPL project.](http://pry.github.com)

Features and limitations
-------------------------

* Only works with MRI 1.9.2 and 1.9.3
* Does not work in 1.8.7, but there is a well known (continuation-based) hack to get a `Binding#of_caller` there.
